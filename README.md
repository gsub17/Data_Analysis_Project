### Why don't we extract data directly from MySQL ?
For extracting data directly from mysql database , it will slow down and affect the main stream business.

#### Data cleaning and ETL

Power BI have data model which shows relationship between different table.
Star Schema - here we have a fact table like transactions table and dimension table like entity table customer name .
